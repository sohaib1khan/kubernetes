# Kubernetes Learning Repository

Welcome to my Kubernetes learning repository! This space chronicles my journey as I delve deeper into the world of Kubernetes. Within these folders, you'll find various projects, configurations, and notes I've accumulated and worked on throughout my learning process.

## Overview

Kubernetes has quickly become the go-to for container orchestration, and this repository is a testament to its capabilities and my dedication to mastering it. From basic setups to more intricate configurations, I've experimented with a multitude of facets within Kubernetes to solidify my understanding.

## What's Inside

- **Projects**: Practical implementations and challenges I've undertaken to get hands-on experience with Kubernetes.
- **Notes**: Insights, issues, and learnings from each experiment. A personal knowledge base of sorts.
- **Configurations**: Various Kubernetes configurations I've crafted for different applications and scenarios.

## Learning Journey

Every folder or file here represents a step in my Kubernetes learning journey. Each has its own significance, be it a triumph over a particularly challenging setup or a simple note-to-self about a newfound Kubernetes feature.

I want to add, I do keep a secondary or more detailed Wiki/Playbook page that offer guides/notes. Sadly this is running off of my home network which is 99.99% of the time is up.
